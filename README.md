# Python API Examples
## by HundredVisionsGuy 

**Purpose:**  demonstrate how to use Python 3 and requests to capture and process JSON data 

## Strategies:
1. Find an open API from [Public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
2. Build a custom URL by combining the 
    * base_url
    * endpoint
    * query parameters
    * Example: 
    ```
    base_url = "https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com"
    endpoint = "/facts/random?animal_type=cat&amount=3"
    url = base_url + endpoint
    ```
3. Make a json call using requests library
    ```
    resp = requests.get(url)
    ```
4. Test against the response 
    * 200 is good
    * anything else = bad
    ```
    if resp.status_code != 200:
        # something went wrong
    else:
        # Success!
        # Now is the time to have some fun.
    ```
5. use the `.json()` method to get the JSON response
6. Use the key to capture
